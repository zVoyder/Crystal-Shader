# Crystal Shader

Custom shader for Unity, designed to create a unique crystal-like effect.
The shader uses a variety of techniques to achieve this look, including refraction, Gaussian blur, Perlin noise, and rim lighting.

## Features

- **Refraction**: The shader simulates the bending of light that occurs when it passes through a transparent material like a crystal.
- **Gaussian Blur**: This is used to soften the edges of the refracted image, giving it a more realistic look.
- **Perlin Noise**: The shader uses Perlin noise to add a subtle texture to the refracted image, enhancing the crystal effect.
- **Rim Lighting**: This effect is used to give the crystal a glowing edge, making it stand out more against its background.

## Properties

- **Specular Color**: The color of the specular highlight.
- **Texture**: The main texture of the shader.
- **Texture Alpha**: The alpha value of the main texture.
- **Transparency**: The transparency of the shader.
- **Glossiness**: The glossiness of the shader.
- **Rim Light Color**: The color of the rim light.
- **Rim Light Power**: The intensity of the rim light.
- **Refraction Strength**: The strength of the refraction effect.
- **Blur Amount**: The amount of Gaussian blur applied to the refracted image.
- **Noise Intensity**: The intensity of the Perlin noise.

Please note that this shader is designed to be used with Unity's Built-in Standard Specular lighting model and requires a Unity version that supports Shader Model 3.0 or higher.
